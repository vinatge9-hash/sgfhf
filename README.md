# The Saffron Table - Website Blueprint

This repository contains static HTML files for The Saffron Table, a modern Indian fusion restaurant in Hyderabad (Jubilee Hills). The site follows a mobile-first approach, uses Tailwind CSS, and includes components such as a responsive header, three-column footer, a Swiper-based testimonials carousel, and several content pages.

What’s included:
- index.html (Home)
- menu.html (Menu)
- about.html (Our Story)
- reservations.html (Reservations)
- gallery.html (Gallery)
- contact.html (Contact)
- README.md (this file)

How to run:
1) Open any of the HTML files in a browser to view the page.
2) Ensure you have internet access to load Tailwind CSS and Swiper assets from CDNs.
3) Optional: replace image placeholders (https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1635405050330-b0824eb1bf26?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3ODkyNDZ8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxkZXNjcmlwdGlvbnxlbnwwfDB8fHwxNzU3MDQ4MTQyfDA&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080) with real image URLs or local assets.

Notes:
- All images in this plan use the placeholder syntax as required: src="https://pixabay.com/get/gd10a5e551a6e93b8b1aea445ec24cd720a380373560a529c98c09c8de10987242f6cfe2292520a18531db011046ef9ed2fa5a6bfcf3045282475755e52461c37_640.jpg".
- The footer uses a dark background with three columns and a centered copyright line (© 2025 The Saffron Table).
- Fonts are loaded via placeholders at the top of each HTML file and applied with inline styles for specific sections per the design rules.
- Accessibility considerations: semantic HTML5 structure, descriptive alt text for all images, keyboard navigable header, and high-contrast text where applicable.
